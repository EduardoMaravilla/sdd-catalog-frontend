      "In this thrilling street racing video game, players are immersed in an underground world, where they can experience the adrenaline rush of racing in challenging urban environments. The game offers two main modes: a story mode, where players follow an immersive narrative while facing off against opponents and the police, and an online mode where drivers compete in events of all kinds, from drag racing, to drifting, to chases. In chase mode, players can choose to be either racing drivers or police officers, each group with different objectives: racers must reach the finish line while dodging AI-controlled officers or players in PvP mode.",
    hpResume2:
      "Customization is key in this game: players can deeply modify the engine, turbo, and even induction, in the classic style of previous installments. They can personalize every detail of the car's body, from spoilers to bumpers, and add unique styles to stand out on the track. With weekly and daily events, plus a free mode to explore the city, the game combines the thrill of street racing with extensive customization and unique challenges that offer hours of intense action. Car styles can be shared with other players, adding a touch of competitiveness and visual creativity to the world of underground racing.",
